# react-cv-generator

This is a solo project to build a CV generator, made without a tutorial or help.

The project will be built using NextJS, React, and Tailwind.

This will be a responsive app targeted to desktop and mobile.

On desktop the left hand side will have the forms to fill, on the right hand side there will be a CV preview.

On mobile there will only be the form with a button to save the CV to pdf.

The biggest roadblock I anticipate is generating multiple of the same components, and yet having each state displayed differently on the right hand side.
